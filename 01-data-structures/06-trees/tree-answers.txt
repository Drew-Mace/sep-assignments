1. The binary search tree was slower in every aspect. I took over 5 seconds to insert all the 100000 elements into the tree where it took just under 1 second for the heap. 

2. I would use a heap if I needed to be able to find the lowest or highest element very quickly. A BST would be a better choice if the organization of the data was more important that just being able to find the lowest/highest element. The BST sorts by value as well but it the way its organized it wont always have the highest or lowest at the top. So if the value needs to be returned quickly then I would go with the heap because finding the element will be much easier since you only will have to look up or down, with the BST you could be searching through the entire tree to find the element you are looking for.
