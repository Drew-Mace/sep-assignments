1. Closed Addressing: Uses another Data structure to accommodate collision data
   Random Hashing: Similar to double hashin in that it avoids clustering by a probe sequence key dependant.                   Probe sequence is generated by a pseudo RNG seeded by the key
   Hashing with Rehashing: Creates new Hash twice the size of original and elements are xferred there.
   
2. I would use linear probing, but instead of looking for the next available slot I would search every two.
