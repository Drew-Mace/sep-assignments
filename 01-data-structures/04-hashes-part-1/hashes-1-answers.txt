Doubling the size of the array isn't the best option because it will also double the amount of memory the CPU allocates for the array. Doubling the length to potentionally only add one more item means there will be a large number of empty indices and wasted space. I am still a bit unsure as to why we wouldn't just add another index as needed. The Bloc documentation says it will increase to the nearest prime number. Why is this more beneficial than just added one more index?
